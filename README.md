# queue
Queue is a small “learning” project for Rust that implements a task spooler like utility written in Rust.

It can launch in daemon mode, listen on a named piped, and execute any commands sent to that pipe. 

Obviously insecure and nowhere near ‘production-ready’, but I wrote it to get a good feel of Rust beyond the syntax/semantics and into actual operational stuff.
